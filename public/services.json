        "description": "Addiction is a biopsychosocial disorder characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli despite adverse consequences.",
        "what": "Addiction is a chronic disease characterized by drug seeking and use that is compulsive, or difficult to control, despite harmful consequences. The initial decision to take drugs is voluntary for most people, but repeated drug use can lead to brain changes that challenge an addicted person’s self-control and interfere with their ability to resist intense urges to take drugs. These brain changes can be persistent, which is why drug addiction is considered a relapsing disease—people in recovery from drug use disorders are at increased risk for returning to drug use even after years of not taking the drug.",
        "sym": ["frequently missing school or work, a sudden disinterest in school activities or work, or a drop in grades or work performance.", "lack of energy and motivation, weight loss or gain, or red eyes.", "lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks.", "drastic changes in behavior and in relationships with family and friends.", "sudden requests for money without a reasonable explanation."],
        "cure": "As with most other chronic diseases, such as diabetes, asthma, or heart disease, treatment for drug addiction generally isn’t a cure. However, addiction is treatable and can be successfully managed. People who are recovering from an addiction will be at risk for relapse for years and possibly for their whole lives. Research shows that combining addiction treatment medicines with behavioral therapy ensures the best chance of success for most patients. Treatment approaches tailored to each patient’s drug use patterns and any co-occurring medical, mental, and social problems can lead to continued recovery."

        "description": "Schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder which can cause delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, trouble with thinking and lack of motivation.",
        "what": "Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally. Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that interferes with a person’s ability to think clearly, manage emotions, make decisions and relate to others. It is a complex, long-term medical illness. Schizophrenia may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior that impairs daily functioning, and can be disabling. People with schizophrenia require lifelong treatment. Early treatment may help get symptoms under control before serious complications develop and may help improve the long-term outlook.",
        "sym": ["hearing voices, seeing things, or smelling things others can’t perceive.", "false beliefs that don’t change even when the person who holds them is presented with new ideas or facts.", "being emotionally flat or speaking in a dull, disconnected way.", "struggling to remember things, organize their thoughts or complete tasks.", "disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech."],
        "cure": "Schizophrenia is a long-term mental disorder that it makes it difficult for an individual to focus, think clearly, interact easily with other people, and keep emotions in check. There is currently no cure for schizophrenia, though there are medications and other treatments that have proven effective in managing certain symptoms, allowing individuals with schizophrenia to achieve quality of life. Treatment is a lifelong necessity for someone with schizophrenia, and assistance with certain aspects of daily living is required for many people with the illness."

        "img": "https://i.ibb.co/R2K9n45/autism-01.png",
        "description": "Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication.",
        "what": "Autism affects the nervous system. One sign of autism is impaired social behavior. Other signs include restricted or repetitive behavior. People once saw intensive support as the main way to manage autism. But current treatments often take a different approach. These treatments have improved social behavior in people with autism. When started in childhood, they may have higher chances of success. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (4th ed.) listed Asperger’s syndrome (AS) as a disorder. Asperger's was once known as “high-functioning autism.” Its symptoms are often similar to but less severe than autism. Delays in language and speech may not be present in Asperger's. People with Asperger’s may live without a diagnosis for years. This is because their behavior can appear normal, if socially awkward.",
        "sym": ["difficulty communicating", "challenges with context or abstract thinking", "difficulty following social norms like taking turns or listening", "avoidance of social groups or relationships", "Dislike of changes in routine"],
        "cure": "There is no cure for autism, but experts agree that the best way to manage symptoms and develop independence skills is through ABA therapy. It’s important to remember that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complicated condition that presents differently in every individual. As research continues to discover the cause of the disorder – prenatal condition, genetics and other unknown factors – health providers should focus on helping people with ASD live full and satisfying lives. At Therapeutic Pathways, our therapists and behavior technicians share the goal of improving the lives of our clients through science-backed, individualized behavior analytic treatment."

        "description": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events.",
        "what": "PTSD has been known by many names in the past, such as “shell shock” during the years of World War I and “combat fatigue” after World War II, but PTSD does not just happen to combat veterans. PTSD can occur in all people, of any ethnicity, nationality or culture, and at any age. PTSD affects approximately 3.5 percent of U.S. adults every year, and an estimated one in 11 people will be diagnosed with PTSD in their lifetime. Women are twice as likely as men to have PTSD. People with PTSD have intense, disturbing thoughts and feelings related to their experience that last long after the traumatic event has ended. They may relive the event through flashbacks or nightmares; they may feel sadness, fear or anger; and they may feel detached or estranged from other people. People with PTSD may avoid situations or people that remind them of the traumatic event, and they may have strong negative reactions to something as ordinary as a loud noise or an accidental touch.",
        "sym": ["intrusive thoughts such as repeated, involuntary memories; distressing dreams.", "avoiding reminders of the traumatic event", "alterations in cognition, mood and behaviour.", "avoidance of social groups or relationships.", "having angry outbursts; behaving recklessly or in a self-destructive way."],
        "cure": "Diagnosis of PTSD requires exposure to an event that involved the actual or possible threat of death, violence or serious injury. Post-traumatic stress disorder treatment can help you regain a sense of control over your life. The primary treatment is psychotherapy, but can also include medication. Most PTSD therapies fall under the umbrella of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The idea is to change the thought patterns that are disturbing your life. This might happen through talking about your trauma or concentrating on where your fears come from. Depending on your situation, group or family therapy might be a good choice for you instead of individual sessions."

        "description": "Couples therapy attempts to improve romantic relationships and resolve interpersonal conflicts.",
        "what": "Couples therapy is a type of psychotherapy in which a licensed therapist with clinical experience working with couples, most often a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT), helps people involved in a romantic relationship gain insight into their relationship, resolve conflict, and improve relationship satisfaction utilizing a variety of therapeutic interventions. Although the practice of behavioral couples therapy may vary depending on the therapist’s theoretical orientation.",
        "sym": ["a focus on a specific problem (i.e. sexual difficulties, Internet addiction, intimacy, jealousy).", "active participation on the part of the therapist in treating the relationship itself, rather than each individual separately.", "Solution-focused, change-oriented interventions early on in treatment.", "A clear establishment of treatment objectives.", "having angry outbursts; behaving recklessly or in a self-destructive way."],
        "cure": "Typically, the first couples therapy session begins with some standard interview questions regarding the history of the relationship as well as deep diving into each partner’s family-of-origin, values, and cultural background. The therapist or marriage counselor also might use the initial sessions for crisis intervention if necessary. The couples therapist will then assist the couple in identifying the issue that will be the focus of treatment, establishing treatment goals and planning a structure for treatment for each counseling session. During treatment, the therapist will help the couple gain insight into the relational dynamics creating the problem and guide both partners to understand their roles in the dysfunctional interactions. This greater insight on relationship issues and distress will help them change the way they perceive the relationship and each other."

        "img": "https://i.ibb.co/dLRZV0m/suicide-Artboard-1-Artboard-1.png",
        "description": "The term suicidality covers suicidal ideation (serious thoughts about taking one's own life), suicide plans and suicide attempts.",
        "what": "Suicidality is when you hurt yourself as a way of dealing with very difficult feelings, painful memories or overwhelming situations and experiences. After self-harming you may feel a short-term sense of release, but the cause of your distress is unlikely to have gone away. Self-harm can also bring up very difficult emotions and could make you feel worse. Even though there are always reasons underneath someone hurting themselves, it is important to know that self-harm does carry risks. Once you have started to depend on self-harm, it can take a long time to stop.",
        "sym": ["talking or writing about suicide — for example, making statements such as I won't be a problem for you much longer", "withdrawing from social contact.", "having mood swings.", "increasing use of alcohol or drugs.", "feeling trapped, hopeless or helpless about a situation."],
        "cure": "At this time, there is only one medication, clozapine, approved by the FDA for suicide risk reduction in patients with schizophrenia. There is one study of mood disorder patients that shows that treatment with antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics, and lithium reduced death by suicide. There are meta-analyses of small lithium studies that show that suicide is reduced in patients with either bipolar disorder or major depression taking lithium, but those findings are controversial. There are two proven psychotherapies for treating those who attempt suicide: cognitive behavior therapy for suicide attempters (CBT for suicide attempters) and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) for patients with borderline personality disorder and recurrent suicidal ideation and behaviors. Clearly theses short term interactive therapies make a difference. There are many small studies of various interventions, including promising short term therapies that include the family, that show that repeat suicide attempts are reduced under the treatment condition being tested."
